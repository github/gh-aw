## What are Agentic Campaigns?

Agentic campaigns are scheduled workflows for work that spans multiple steps and is easier to manage with shared coordination and progress tracking.

Campaigns can be large (like migrations) or small (like a one-week cleanup) initiatives.

Each campaign includes:
- **Markdown** to document the goal, work breakdown, and reporting
- **Worker agents** that autonomously execute the work
- **Progress tracking** to show status and next steps

## When should I use an agentic campaign?

Use a campaign when you want a clear plan and ongoing progress updates, for example: 
- Large-scale migrations (e.g., framework upgrades, API deprecations)
- Cross-cutting refactors (e.g., module splits, dependency cleanup)
- Smaller initiatives (e.g., reliability cleanup week, docs refresh)

Don't use a campaign for simple tasks that don't need coordination, such as:
- Single tasks (e.g., triaging issues, writing a blog post)
- One-off processes (e.g., code reviews, generating documentation)

## How it works

The `shared/campaign.md` import provides:

- **Safe-output defaults** - Pre-configured limits for project updates, issues, and status updates
- **Coordination rules** - Best practices for discovery, deterministic execution, and reporting
- **Project integration** - Standard patterns for tracking work in GitHub Projects
