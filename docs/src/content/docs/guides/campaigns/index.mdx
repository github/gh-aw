## What are Campaigns?

Campaigns enable workflows to automatically track their progress in [GitHub Projects](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#github-projects-projects-v2). This is useful when you need to coordinate multiple workflows or track work across repositories.

## Quick Start

Add the `project` field to your workflow frontmatter to enable project tracking:

```yaml wrap
---
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
project: https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/1
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    max: 5
---

# Dependency Upgrade Campaign

Scan for outdated dependencies and create issues to track upgrades.

1. Check for outdated dependencies
2. Create issues for each outdated package
3. Issues are automatically added to the project board
```

This automatically enables project management capabilities like adding items, updating fields, and posting status updates.

## When to Use Project Tracking

Use the `project` field when you need:

- **Progress visibility** - Track workflow-created items in a central project board
- **Status updates** - Automatically update item status as work progresses
- **Team coordination** - Share workflow progress with stakeholders
- **Multi-repo tracking** - Monitor work across multiple repositories

**Don't need project tracking?** A simple workflow without the `project` field is simpler if you don't need centralized tracking.

## Configuration

Use a project URL in your workflow frontmatter:

```yaml
project: https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/1
```

## How It Works

When you add the `project` field:

1. **Automatic safe-outputs** - The compiler adds `update-project` and `create-project-status-update` safe-outputs
2. **Project operations** - Your workflow can add items, update fields, and post status updates
3. **Token configuration** - Uses your configured token (or creates one with `gh aw secrets set`)

## Worker Workflows

You can coordinate multiple workflows by having them all use the same project URL:

```yaml
# worker-1.md
---
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
project: https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/1
---
# Worker 1: Creates issues
```

```yaml
# worker-2.md
---
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
project: https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/1
---
# Worker 2: Creates PRs
```

Both workers will automatically track their items in the same project board.
