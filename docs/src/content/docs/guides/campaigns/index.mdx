## Campaigns in one line

**Campaigns coordinate multiple autonomous agents working toward a shared goal, with built-in progress tracking via GitHub Projects.**

## What are Agentic Campaigns?

Agentic Campaigns are workflows that coordinate autonomous agents across one or more repositories to drive progress toward a shared goal and make that progress easy to track.

They run on a schedule and use:
- `imports` to include standard agent coordination rules from `shared/campaign.md`
- `project` to optionally track work with automatic [GitHub Projects](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#github-projects-projects-v2) integration

## Getting Started

To create your first campaign workflow with step-by-step instructions, see the [Getting Started guide](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/getting-started/).

## Agent Coordination Pattern

The `shared/campaign.md` import provides:

- **Safe-output defaults** - Pre-configured limits for project updates, issues, and status updates
- **Coordination rules** - Best practices for discovery, deterministic execution, and reporting
- **Project integration** - Standard patterns for tracking work in GitHub Projects

## When should this just be a workflow?

Use this decision table to determine if you need a campaign (agent coordination) or just a regular workflow:

| **Scenario** | **Use Campaign** | **Use Regular Workflow** |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Work spans multiple repos** | ✅ Yes - coordinate across repos | ❌ No - unless each repo is independent |
| **Need central progress tracking** | ✅ Yes - GitHub Projects integration | ❌ No - unless simple status updates suffice |
| **Coordinating multiple agents** | ✅ Yes - agent coordination pattern | ❌ No - single agent is simpler |
| **Systematic, recurring work** | ✅ Yes - scheduled discovery + updates | ⚠️ Maybe - simple schedules work too |
| **Team visibility required** | ✅ Yes - shared project board | ❌ No - notifications may be enough |
| **One-off automation task** | ❌ No - too much overhead | ✅ Yes - regular workflow is simpler |
| **Simple trigger → action** | ❌ No - over-engineered | ✅ Yes - regular workflow is cleaner |
| **No progress tracking needed** | ❌ No - unnecessary complexity | ✅ Yes - keep it simple |

**Rule of thumb:** If you're not tracking work items in a GitHub Project or coordinating multiple agents, you probably just need a regular workflow.
