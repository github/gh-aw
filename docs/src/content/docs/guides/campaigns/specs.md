banner:
  content: '<strong>⚠️ Deprecated:</strong> The <code>.campaign.md</code> file format is no longer supported. Use the <code>project</code> field in workflow frontmatter instead.'

:::caution[File format removed]
The `.campaign.md` standalone file format has been **removed** from gh-aw.

**Current approach:** Use the `project` field in regular workflow frontmatter for project tracking.

See [Getting Started](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/getting-started/) for how to use the current implementation.
