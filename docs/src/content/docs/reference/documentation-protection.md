## Overview

The `disable-agentic-editing` frontmatter field provides a mechanism to mark documentation pages as protected from automated agent modifications. When this field is set to `true` in a page's frontmatter, it signals to AI agents and automated workflows that the content should remain untouched.

## Usage

Add the `disable-agentic-editing` field to the frontmatter section of any documentation page:

```markdown
---
title: My Protected Page
description: This page should not be automatically edited
disable-agentic-editing: true
---

Your carefully curated content here...
```

## When to Use This Field

Consider enabling this protection for:

### Auto-Generated Content
Pages that are programmatically generated from external sources should be protected to prevent conflicts between manual agent edits and regeneration processes.

```markdown
---
title: API Reference (Auto-Generated)
disable-agentic-editing: true
---

<!-- This content is generated by scripts/generate-api-docs.js -->
```

### Release Notes and Changelogs
Historical records that document specific releases should remain immutable once published.

```markdown
---
title: Release 1.0.0 Notes
disable-agentic-editing: true
date: 2024-01-15
---

Official release notes for version 1.0.0...
```

### Manually Curated Lists
Curated collections where ordering, selection, or specific wording is intentionally maintained.

```markdown
---
title: Community Showcase
disable-agentic-editing: true
---

Handpicked examples from the community...
```

### Legal and Compliance Content
Documentation with legal implications that requires careful human review for any changes.

```markdown
---
title: Terms of Service
disable-agentic-editing: true
---

Legal terms and conditions...
```

## How Agents Should Respect This Field

When an AI agent encounters a page with `disable-agentic-editing: true`:

1. **Skip automated edits** - Do not modify the content of the page
2. **Report the limitation** - Inform users that the page is protected
3. **Suggest alternatives** - Recommend creating new pages or manual review
4. **Read-only access** - The agent may still read and reference the content

## Example: Protected Documentation Workflow

Here's how this field integrates with automated documentation workflows:

```markdown
---
title: Architecture Diagram
disable-agentic-editing: true
---

<!-- 
  This diagram is maintained using a specific tool and exported manually.
  Automated agents should not attempt to regenerate or modify it.
-->

![Architecture](./architecture.svg)

The architecture consists of...
```

## Checking Protection Status

Agents and tooling can query the frontmatter to check if a page is protected:

```typescript
import { getEntry } from 'astro:content';

const page = await getEntry('docs', 'reference/protected-page');

if (page.data['disable-agentic-editing']) {
  console.log('This page is protected from automated edits');
  // Skip modification logic
}
```

## Best Practices

### Be Selective
Only protect pages that truly need it. Over-protection can limit the benefits of automated documentation improvements.

### Document the Reason
Add comments explaining why a page is protected to help future maintainers understand the decision.

```markdown
---
title: Special Configuration
disable-agentic-editing: true
# Protected: This page contains manually optimized examples that have been
# reviewed by the security team. Changes must go through formal review.
---
```

### Review Periodically
Regularly audit protected pages to determine if protection is still necessary as documentation practices evolve.

### Combine with Other Protections
Use alongside other safeguards like branch protection rules and required reviewers for comprehensive protection.
